    <pre>I'm on the floor
Counting one minute more
No one to break the silence

[Pre-Chorus]
Staring into the night
All alone but that's alright
It's the feeling deep inside I don't like

[Chorus]
There is no excuse, my friend
For breaking my heart
Breaking my heart again
This is where our journey ends
You're breaking my heart again

[Verse 2]
Here in my bed
Counting the words you've said
They linger in the shadows

[Pre-Chorus]
Coming home late at night
Drunk again but that's alright
It's the look in your eyes I don't like
See Michael Learns to Rock Live
Get tickets as low as $112
